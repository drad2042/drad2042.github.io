My name is Daniel Radunsky, and I am currently a student at Penn State University - University Park, majoring in Computational Data Sciences in the College of Engineering, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. I am also a Data Science Intern at [Zendrop](https://zendrop.com/), where I continue to develop and apply my skills. I am actively seeking opportunities in data-driven and software engineering roles where I can apply my passion  for utilizing technology to address complex challenges. I have developed proficiency in various programming languages and tools, effectively applying these skills in collaborative professional environments. Beyond my professional experience, I am involved in extracurricular activities at Penn State. Previously, I was a member of the Penn State Esports Club, where I interacted with others who share a mutual interest in video games. Currently, I serve as the Training Director for Nittany Data Labs, where I design interactive Python and SQL labs and deliver presentations to help students explore real-world applications of data science that can benefit their careers. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also significantly enhanced my leadership and collaboration abilities. In my downtime, I enjoy playing video games, soccer, chess, and exploring new music.
