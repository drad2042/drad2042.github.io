## About Me
My name is Daniel Radunsky, and I am currently a student at Penn State University - University Park, majoring in Computational Data Sciences in the College of Engineering, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. I am also a Data Scientist Intern at <a href="https://zendrop.com/" target="_blank">Zendrop</a> where I continue to develop and apply my skills. I am actively seeking opportunities in data-driven and software engineering roles where I can apply my passion  for utilizing technology to address complex challenges. I have developed proficiency in various programming languages and tools, effectively applying these skills in collaborative professional environments. \

Beyond my professional experience, I am involved in extracurricular activities at Penn State. Previously, I was a member of the Penn State Esports Club. Currently, I serve as the Training Director for Nittany Data Labs, where I design interactive machine learning and data-science related labs and deliver presentations to help students explore real-world applications of data/computer science that can benefit their careers. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also significantly enhanced my leadership and collaboration abilities. \

I have dedicated a significant amount of time to completing various personal projects. Some of these include creating a DeepFake Detector and a Fake News Detector using various implementations of neural networks. Another one of my comprehensive projects includes creating an interactive chatbot that allows users to summarize their emails by highlighting main points and prioritizing important messages. I designed it using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, combining a vector database, a large language model (LLM), and a word-embedding model to make the summaries simple and accurate. The objective was to streamline email management to allow users to focus on other high-priority tasks. \
